                <div class="profile-content">
                    <p>Yuji Sato received his B.E. degree from the University of Tokyo, Japan in 1981. From 1981 to 2000, he worked at Hitachi, Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan, where he was involved in the development of bipolar CMOS gate arrays, logic structure reconfigurable LSI, and neurocomputers, and filed dozens of patents.</p>

                    <p>In 1997, he received his Ph.D. degree in Engineering from the University of Tokyo. In April 2000, he joined the Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences at Hosei University, Japan, as an Associate Professor, and became a Professor in April 2001. He served as the Dean of the Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences from April 2016 to March 2018.</p>

                    <p>From 2007 to 2008, he was a visiting scholar at the Illinois Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (IlliGAL). At Hosei University, he has been involved in undergraduate and graduate education and research, supervising four doctoral students to date, and has published 37 journal papers (including 18 SCI journal papers) and more than 100 peer-reviewed international conference papers, primarily at ACM/SIGEVO GECCO, IEEE CEC, IEEE SMC, IJCNN, and others.</p>
